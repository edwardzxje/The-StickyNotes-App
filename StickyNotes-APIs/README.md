# Stickynotes APIs Directory

This directory contains the API definitions and implementations for the StickyNotes application.

## Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

- `api.http`: Contains sample HTTP requests for testing the APIs.
- `stickynotes_api.yaml`: The API definition file in YAML format.
- `http-client.env.json`: Contains the environment variables for the HTTP client.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the directory and instructions for usage and contribution.

## Usage

Each API module is designed to be self-contained with all necessary routes and utility functions. 

To use these APIs, import the desired module into your application's main server file, and bind the routes to your application instance.

## Documentation

Each file contains inline documentation for all endpoints and their expected request and response formats. For detailed API documentation with examples, please refer to the `docs` directory.
